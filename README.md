# Pizzeria

Overview
This project aims to analyze the inventory, staff, and order data of a pizzeria to optimize operational efficiency and enhance decision-making. Using SQL, the relevant data was extracted and processed, followed by the creation of interactive dashboards in Looker, connected through a free Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instance.

Objectives

-Orders Dashboard:
  * Identify the top-selling products and pizzas.
  * Analyze the distribution of delivery orders versus in-store orders.
  * Determine the geographical areas with the highest order volumes.
    
-Inventory Dashboard:
  * Establish a minimum threshold for each ingredient.
  * Monitor inventory levels and highlight items that reach or fall below the minimum threshold to facilitate reordering.
  * Calculate how much each pizza costs to make based on the cost of the ingredients, to keep an eye on pricing and P/L

-Staff Dashboard:
  * Track staff working hours.
  * Calculate the associated labor costs.
